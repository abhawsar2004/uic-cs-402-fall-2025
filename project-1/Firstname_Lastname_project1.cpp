/* Bubble Sort 
 *
 * 5 points
 * 
 * Algorithm: Continuously compare adjacent elements and swap them if necessary.
 *            This is a stable, in-place sorting algorithm. Your implementation must be in-place.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  vector<T> &list: reference to a list of type T. You can assume this type
 *                   has all of the normal binary comparison operators such
 *                   as <, >, ==, !=, etc.
 *  bool decending:  if true, then sort in descending order; otherwise sort
 *                   in ascending order (the default)
 * */
template<typename T>
void bubble_sort(vector<T> &list, bool descending) {
    // Your code here!
}














/* Selection Sort 
 *
 * 5 points
 * 
 * Algorithm: Continuously finds the minimium (or maximum) element in the list, 
 *            then swaps it with the first non-sorted element of the list.
 *            This is an unstable, in-place sorting algorithm. Your implementation must be in-place.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  vector<T> &list: reference to a list of type T. You can assume this type
 *                   has all of the normal binary comparison operators such
 *                   as <, >, ==, !=, etc.
 *  bool decending:  if true, then sort in descending order; otherwise sort
 *                   in ascending order (the default)
 * */
template<typename T>
void selection_sort(vector<T> &list, bool descending) {

/* Insertion Sort 
 *
 * 5 points
 * 
 * Algorithm: Iterates through the list and inserts the current element into
 *            the correct sorted position of the prefix of the list.
 *            This is a stable, in-place sorting algorithm. Your implementation
 *            does not need to be in-place.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  vector<T> &list: reference to a list of type T. You can assume this type
 *                   has all of the normal binary comparison operators such
 *                   as <, >, ==, !=, etc.
 *  bool decending:  if true, then sort in descending order; otherwise sort
 *                   in ascending order (the default)
 * */
template<typename T>

/* Quicksort 
 *
 * 10 points
 * 
 * Algorithm: Sorts by first choosing a random pivot from the list, then 
 *            partitioning the list into two halves with respect to the 
 *            pivot, then recursing on each half.
 *            This is an unstable sorting algorithm. Not required to be
 *            implemented as an in-place sort.
 *            
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  vector<T> &list: reference to a list of type T. You can assume this type
 *                   has all of the normal binary comparison operators such
 *                   as <, >, ==, !=, etc.
 *  bool decending:  if true, then sort in descending order; otherwise sort
 *                   in ascending order (the default)
 *
 * */

/* Merge Sort 
 *
 * 10 points
 * 
 * Algorithm: Sorts the list by recursively sorting the left and right
 *            halves, then merging the two left and right halves together.
 *            This is a stable sorting algorithm. Not required to be implemented
 *            as an in-place sort.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  vector<T> &list: reference to a list of type T. You can assume this type
 *                   has all of the normal binary comparison operators such
 *                   as <, >, ==, !=, etc.

/* Bucket Merge Sort
 *
 * 20 points
 * 
 * Algorithm: Bucket Merge Sort we discussed in class. Works by
 *            partitioning the input list into small, fixed-length segments,
 *            sorting each of those segments using some fast algorithm, then
 *            merging each of the segments together.
 *            This is a stable, in-place sorting algorithm.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  vector<T> &list: reference to a list of type T. You can assume this type
 *                   has all of the normal binary comparison operators such
 *                   as <, >, ==, !=, etc.

/* Binary Radix Sort

 * Parameters: 
 *   vector<T> &list: reference to a list of type T.
 *                    IMPORTANT: this type T is assumed to be *integral*. It
 *                    can be any of the following integral types in C++:
 *                      - (unsigned) short int
 *                      - (unsigned) int
 *                      - (unsigned) long int

/* Your Hybrid Sort
 *
 * 25 points
 *
 * Algorithm: Your own custom Hybrid Sorting algorithm! Remember, a hybrid
 *            sort tries to take advantage of two (or more) sorting algorithms
 *            to speed up data processing.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  vector<T> &list: reference to a list of type T. You can assume this type
 *                   has all of the normal binary comparison operators such
 *                   as <, >, ==, !=, etc.

/* Base B Radix Sort 
 *
 * 25 Points
 *
 * Algorithm: Implement Radix Sort as discussed in class, but with
 *            respect to any unspecified base.
 *
 * Parameters: 
 *   vector<T> &list: reference to a list of type T.
 *                    IMPORTANT: this type T is assumed to be *integral*. It
 *                    can be any of the following integral types in C++:
 *                      - (unsigned) short int
 *                      - (unsigned) int
 *                      - (unsigned) long int
 *
 *   unsigned int base: the base with which to implement the radix sort. 
 *                      Note that base should be at least 2. The default
 *                      base is 10.
 *
 *   bool decending: if true, then sort in descending order; otherwise sort
 *                   in ascending order (the default).
 *
 *
 * Additional Information:
 *   - If you are enrolled in the graduate section of this course, you MUST
 *     implement this function (i.e., it counts towards your total grade).
 *
 *   - If you are enrolled in the undergraduate section of this course, this
 *     function is optional and worth extra credit.
